# Covid-19_probability_detector0.2
```
The COVID-19 Probability Detector works specifically for finding the probability of infected people. 
This application contains a set of features that is : 
fever, runny nose, cough, body pain, age, difficulty in breathing.  
These features allows to find probability using machine learning logistic regression model 
and train this model using fit function.

# Objective
```
The main objective of this project is to build the model which will be able to predict
the probability of infection. 
To fulfill the objective Iâ€™m doing following mythology-:
1.Stop transmission by prioritizing the test and hence detecting  the case quickly.
2.Data can be collected on symptoms of COVID-19.
3.A machine learning model then is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person 
having the infection.
4.The model is then used to find out whom to find potential candidate to conducting random test.
